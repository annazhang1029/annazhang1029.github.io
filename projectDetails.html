    Abstract
</h2>
<p> I aim to build a model for glucose prediction using the preferred architecture.
    According to National Diabetes Statistics Report from Centers for Disease Control (CDC), by 2020, there are 34.2 million 
    Americans with Diabetes, which is 1 in every 10 people. Therefore,
    glucose prediction, with its poten- tial use in ”artificial pancreas”,
    has become crucial in the realm of managing patients’ glucose level and taking necessary precautions.
    In this paper, we develop a glucose prediction algorithm for patients to predict their blood sugar level in the future 30 minutes and
    60 minutes with the input data of last 4 hours. The general data set from a Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) simulator is
    of three input fields – glucose levels, insulin, and time. The model is built by Re- current Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory
    network (LSTM). Eventually, the results are evaluated by the mean squared error (MSE) between the actual blood sugar levels and
    the predicted ones. The mean value of the best MSE (unscaled) of the three out of ten patients in 30 minutes is 0.0138,
    while the mean value in 60 minutes is 0.0093. From the results, we can see that the performance of the prediction model is fairly accurate.
    As a result, we can conclude that applying LSTM to the task of pre- dicting blood sugar level in the future is a favorable choice.
